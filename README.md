# Abstract

Objectives

Patients with Parkinson’s disease may develop dementia. Being able to predict individual risk of dementia at different timepoints could help clinicians decide when to offer early personalised treatment and inform healthcare planning. We aimed to develop the first prognostic model that could dynamically update a patient’s risk of dementia.  

Methods

We analysed pooled data from 5 prospective incidence cohorts in the UK (CamPalGN, PICNICS, PINE), Norway (ParkWest), and Sweden (NYPUM). Dynamic prognostic models were developed under a joint modelling framework with individual-participant-data meta-analysis. We used baseline and longitudinal measurements MMSE (mental exam) and MDS-UPDRS III (motor function test) to predict the risk of dementia over 3 years, shifting the time of prediction to be annually from baseline to 7 years post baseline. Missing data were imputed with multiple imputation. We assessed heterogeneity in discrimination and calibration performance between cohorts by internal-external cross-validation (IECV). 

Results

For the model developed on all cohorts, the IECV showed large heterogeneity in model performance between studies. Therefore, two models had to be developed and validated. The first one was developed from the NYPUM and PINE studies. The time-dependent AUC ranged from 0.59-0.81 in NYPUM and from 0.69-0.81 in PINE. For NYPUM, the model showed good calibration for some time points but not for others. For PINE, the calibration performance was very good at all prediction times after year 1. The second prognostic model was developed from the ParkWest study. The external validation showed that time-dependent AUC in CamPalGN ranged from 0.65-0.83, and in PICNICS from 0.56-0.69. Calibration performance was mixed across different prediction time points in CamPalGN and PICNICS. 

Conclusion

Dynamic prediction models showed reasonable discrimination ability. However, calibration was poor across some time points which may be due to heterogeneity in follow-up frequency for longitudinal measures. Future work will involve recalibrating such models.
